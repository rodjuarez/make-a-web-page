          What is the Web?
      	</div>
      	<div class=“block-concept-description”>
          <p>
            The <b><em>Web</em></b> is the collection of all the HTML documents that exist in the largest network, which is a series of servers.
          </p>
        </div>
	      <div class=“block-concept-title”>
          What is HTML?
      	</div>
	      <div class=“block-concept-description”>
          <p>
            <b><em>HTML</em></b> stands for <b><em>Hyper Text Markup Language,</em></b> which is the language that browsers interpret as what we see as pages in the Internet. At the end it is a programming language. It is estimated that around 30 billion HTML pages exist on the Internet.
          </p>
        </div>
	      <div class=“block-concept-title”>
          What are URLs?
      	</div>
	      <div class=“block-concept-description”>
          <p>
            It stands for <b><em>Uniform Resource Locator</em></b> and it is the standard to request information and locate HTML pages on the Internet. A URL is sent to the server that stores the page requested and the server sends back that particular page to be interpreted by the browser of the individual computer where the request was sent.
          </p>
        </div>
	      <div class=“block-concept-title”>
          What is HTTP?
      	</div>
      	<div class=“block-concept-description”>
          <p>
            It stands for <b><em>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol,</em></b> which is the protocol, or series of standardize instructions that the Internet uses to link HTML pages.

          How does the Internet Works?
      	</div>
        <div class=“block-concept-description”>
          <p>
            User sends a request from a device
            <br>The URL requested goes to the Internet
            <br>Through the HTTP protocol it is located in a server
            <br>The server sends the requested URL through HTTP
            <br>The URL travels through the Internet
            <br>The link is accomplished through the user’s browser which interprets the HTML Page for the user to read/see/listen.
          </p>
      	</div>
      	<div class=“block-concept-title”>
          What is a Tag?
	      </div>
	      <div class=“block-concept-description”>
          <p>
            A <b><em>Tag</em></b> is an HTML label describing the content of an HTML page. Tags are always contained within a less than and a more than brackets. And in most cases are used in pairs, an opening tag “(tag)” and a closing tag “(/tag)".
          </p>
        </div>
      	<div class=“block-concept-title”>
          What is a Void Tag?
      	</div>
	      <div class=“block-concept-description”>
          <p>
            A <b><em>Void Tag</em></b> has no content and therefore does not require a closing tag. Examples of a void tag are the bracket tag “(br), and image tag “(img)”.
          </p>
        </div>
	      <div class=“block-concept-title”>
          What is an Inline Tag?
      	</div>
	      <div class=“block-concept-description”>
          <p>
            <b><em>Inline Tags</em></b> are simple line tags. That is, they are not contained in boxes. Examples are: the (br), (img), (em), (b) tags, etc.
          </p>
        </div>
	      <div class=“block-concept-title”>
          What is a Block Tag?
      	</div>
      	<div class=“block-concept-description”>
          <p>
            <b><em>Block Tags</em></b> are always contained in boxes (although not always seen as such through their representation of the content. Examples are: The paragraph tag “(p)(/p)”, the anchor tag “(a)(/a)”, or the division tag “(div)(/div)”.
          </p>
        </div>
	      <div class=“block-concept-title”>
          What is an Element?
      	</div>
      	<div class=“block-concept-description”>
          <p>
            An <b><em>Element</em></b> is everything that is contained between an opening and a closing tag.
          </p>
        </div>
	      <div class=“block-concept-title”>
          What is an Attribute?
        </div>
        <div class=“block-concept-description”>
          <p>
            <b><em>Attributes</em></b> are properties assigned to the content in a tag, such as color, font, size, location, border size, etc.
          </p>

          HTML
        </div>
        <div class=“block-concept-title”>
          Elements
        </div>
        <div class=“block-concept-description”>
          <p>
            HTML is written with content that is placed within TAGs. All the content within these two TAGs is called ELEMENT.

	          Computers are stupid!
      	</div>
      	<div class=“block-concept-description”>
          <p>
            This means that a computer cannot reason, “figure out” what a programmer might have meant for it to do, but rather that unless precise instructions are given, a computer will not know what to do. It has to be guided step by step, and thus, the programmer has to code in this manner.

	        How the Web Works
	      </div>
	      <div class=“block-concept-description”>
          <p>
            A user sends a request to obtain an HTML Page that contains the information requires through a browser. The requests travels through the Internet which is comprised of the biggest network of computers through a series of preset rules of how that information is to be sent, travel, received and reassembled by the server that contains the information requested. The server returns the information using the same set  of rules, called the HTTP protocol, or Hyper Text Transport Protocol, providing the URL to the user’s browser or Uniform Resource Locator of where that HTML resides and the browser interprets the HTML code in a viewable manner for the user to see, read or hear.

          Inline vs Block Elements
      	</div>
      	<div class=“block-concept-description”>
          <p>
            Certain elements are simple lines of content while others are contained in boxes. These “boxes” are in most cases invisible in the Browser to the user’s view but by having them in boxes allows the programmer move them around and to assign attributes to them in an easier manner.

            The Path from Being a Novice to Becoming an Expert.
          </p>
        </div>
      	<div class=“block-concept-description”>
          <p>
            It was discussed the path from being a novice to an expert. All a novice starts with are scattered facts, and a gap exists between that and becoming an expert. Reflection is what allows the novice to gap the distance from novice to expert. While one might have good ideas, in order to achieve the ability to execute them, one has to gap this distance through practice until one can act as an expert implementer of such ideas.

          CSS Definitions
        </div>
        <div class=“block-concept-description”>
          <p>
            Browsers provide developer tools that allow the programmer to see the HTML coding and to code in a <em>“tree”</em> form. That means to code in a way that represents a tree: A trunk, branches, twigs, leafs, fruit. In other words, to code in a way that similar elements, or similar content can be placed within sections and add notes that will help identify and change the code in a future. (div) tags are used to separate content into boxes. (span) tags are used for inline elements.
        	</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Lesson 3 – Adding CSS Style to the HTML Structure</h2>
        <div class=“block-concept-title”>
          CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets
	      </div>
	      <div class=“block-concept-description”>
	        <p>
            CSS provides a way to avoid repetition, and an easier way to change the attributes of like elements at once providing consistency. The cleaner the code is (less repetition) the easier it will be to follow and the faster it will load.
          </p>
	        <p>
            Coding should always be <b><em>”structured”</b></em>, meaning that divisions (div) tags have been used to separate logically combined elements into blocks for easier manipulation, understanding, and debugging, thus the term <b><em>”Cascading”</b></em>, or 
	        </p>
          <p>
            The term <b><em>”Styles”</b></em> term comes from the fact that the elements in the HTML coding can be manipulated with different <b><em>“selectors”</b></em> such as font, size, color, etc. These styles can be specified to particular elements, but CSS Styles are better applied when similar elements are manipulated at once by these selectors, such as headers, content, titles, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            The term <b><em>”Sheets”</b></em> refers to the fact that many different set of CSS coding can be defined for one HTML document, each one having unique coding to different parts of the HTML page. However, one must be careful not to create many CSS sheets when the code could be included in only one. It is important to point out that changing the visual properties of an element only change the way that they are displayed by the browser, and not the type of element that it is.
          </p>
        </div>
      	<div class=“block-concept-title”>
          Inheritance
        </div>
        <div class=“block-concept-description”>
          <p>
            <b>CSS</b> has a key feature called <b><em>“Inheritance”</b></em>, which means that the properties are not just applied to a specific element, but also to its descendant elements on a tree structure, in other words, according to its hierarchy, also called nesting. However, two things must be remembered:
            <br>
            1.	The most descriptive style is the one that overrules the style.
            <br>
            2.	Box related properties are not inherited
            <br>
            The properties that <b>can be inherited</b> are: color, font, letter spacing, line height, list style, text align, text indent, text transform, visibility, white space and word spacing.   
            <br>
            The properties that <b>cannot be inherited</b> are: background, border, display, float and clear, height and width, margin, min and max height and width, outline, overflow, padding, position, text decoration, vertical align and z-index.
            <br>
            Inheritance reduces the amount of code that developers need to write.
          </p>       
        </div>
        <div class=“block-concept-title”>
	        Selectors Coding
	      </div>
	      <div class=“block-concept-description”>
	        <p>
            A <b><em>“Selector”</b></em> specifies the element or like elements that it will modify. The coding of the selector contains the <em>element</em>, a <em>left curly bracket</em> on the first line. On the second line an <em>attribute followed by a colon</em>, a <em>value followed by a semi colon</em> on the second line. And a <em>right curly bracket</em> on line three, closing the selector.
	          <br>
            An example would be:
            <br>
            .content {
            <br>
              color: green;
            <br>
          	}
	        </p>
        </div>
        <div class=“block-concept-title”>
	        Rules
	      </div>
	      <div class=“block-concept-description”>
        	<p>
	          Everything that is contained within the curly brackets is called a <b><em>rule</b></em>. The rule is applied to the element.
        	</p>
	      </div>
        <div class=“block-concept-title”>
	        Adding CSS into a Web Page
	      </div>
	      <div class=“block-concept-description”>
        	<p>
            <b>There are 3 methods to add CSS into a Web Page:</b>
          	<br><b>1) Adding the CSS code into the <em>Head</em> section of the HTML page.</b> Good for small projects.
          	<br>
            <b>2) Writing the CSS code into a separate file and linking it to the Web page</b>. The link should be placed within the <em>Head</em> section of the HTML page with come such as: <b><em>“<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css">”</b></em>. This is particularly more efficient for larger projects.
	          <br>
	          <b>3) Writing the CSS code inline with the HTML code.</b> This is the least effective method as it creates repetition and thus inefficient coding, larger lines of code, and slower processing, as well as the opportunity for more mistakes.
	        </p>
        </div>
        <div class=“block-concept-title”>
	        Code Comments
	      </div>
	      <div class=“block-concept-description”>
	        <p>
            <b><em>Code Comments</b></em> are comments left by the programmer to remind himself of particulars that would not to forgot and that will help him identify and troubleshoot particular areas of the code, as well as for all other programmers that will look into the code. Properly coded these comments are not displayed by the browser, so they can only be seen through the coding.
	          <br>
	          Example:
          	<br>
	          <b>Comments in HTML</b>
          	<br>In <b>HTML</b> code comments begin with “<!—”, it is then followed by the comment or comments, and it closes with “-->”.
	          <br>In <b>CSS</b> code comments begin with “/*”, followed by the comment or comments, and it closes with */”.
	        </p> 
	      </div>
      	<div class=“block-concept-title”>
	        Boxes
	      </div>
	      <div class=“block-concept-description”>
        	<p>
            In HTML all elements are boxes, even as they are not necessarily displayed by the browsers. Each box, going from the core out is formed by the <b><em>content</b></em> at its core, then surrounded by the <b><em>padding</b></em> which is a clear space around the content that avoids overlapping and that is affected by the background color of the box. The padding is surrounded by a <b><em>border</b></em> which inherits from the box too, and the border is surrounded by a <b><em>margin</b></em> which is the transparent outer space of the box.
	        </p>
	        <p>
            To calculate the size of a box one must add the width of the content, plus both sizes of the padding, plus the size of both sides of the border. Sizing these boxes in a precise manner is complicated. There are 3 ways to do this:
	          <br>
	          <b>1) You can specify the size of the box in pixels</b> which is a hard form of sizing them and they never change in size.
	          <br>
          	<b>2) You can specify the size of  the box in percentage</b> which will resize the box depending on the size in which the page is being viewed.
	          <br>
	          <b>3) You can mix the prior two ways.</b> You could, for example, specify a max or minimum size in a <em>flex</em> resizing manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            The flex sizing option should be added as a rule in the following manner: <b><em>display: flex;</b></em>.
          </p>

	        Coding CSS and Browser Differences
	      </div>
      	<div class=“block-concept-description”>
          <p>
	          Because there are differences in the way different browsers display HTML and CSS, in order to ensure that the viewer will see our coding the way we intended it to be seen, the following rule needs to be added in CSS:
          	<br>
	          *{
	          <br>
	            -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
	          <br>
	            -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
	           <br>
            	-ms-box-sizing: border-box;
          	<br>
          	}
        	</p>
